# Photo Studio OS Frontend v2 Gap Map

Date: 2026-05-07
Target repo: `A:\Photo_Studio_OS_Frontend`
Source reference set: `A:\Photo_Studio_OS\.agent_board\references\photo_studio_v2`

This gap map compares the current read-only Frontend Alpha against the selected v2 product, UI, visual, token, and fixture references copied into the control workspace.

Boundary:

- This is a planning document only.
- The frontend remains read-only and mock-first.
- Do not add upload, download, auth, storage, external Review links, external Delivery links, approval writes, backend mutations, or production connections from this task.
- Current frontend `AGENTS.md`, repository reality, and approved Command Center Alpha scope override the v2 reference documents.

## Implementation Status

As of the current Frontend v2 local state, the read-only production loop has moved through the P1B realization slice:

- Command Center visible copy, rail labels, gauge labels, risk/approval/activity copy, and read-model surfaces are Chinese-first.
- Four dedicated hash read-only pages exist: `#asset-inbox`, `#qc-retouch`, `#review-gallery`, and `#delivery-readiness`.
- These pages are mock-first by default and only call backend read-model fetchers when `VITE_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL` is configured.
- Asset Inbox is now a dedicated read-only production workspace with Capture One intake status, thumbnail grid, selected asset preview, binding/file detail, disabled upload/download posture, and QC checklist.
- QC / Retouch is now a dedicated read-only queue workspace with selected item detail, failure reasons, severity, owner, due time, technical/manual checks, retouch instructions, and disabled suggested-action posture.
- Review Gallery is now a dedicated read-only client review workspace with gallery grid, selected review item, client feedback/revision state, status summary, disabled public review, and disabled feedback write posture.
- Delivery Readiness is now a dedicated read-only delivery outbox workspace with package/manifest summary, readiness checklist, blockers, selected output preview, disabled download, and disabled external delivery posture.
- All four read-model hash pages share a production context bar for `projectId`, `reviewSessionId`, `deliveryId`, `mock-first / read-only`, and return-to-Command-Center navigation.
- Command Center now exposes the first Golden Product Loop IDs through a compact `黄金链路` entry strip with four read-only page links.
- P2 cockpit browser polish has fixed the 1280px side-rail breakpoint and the 390px Command Center topbar status line.
- Read-model UI now shares repeated disabled action pairs and repeated metric strip rendering.
- DEV-only read-model boundary rehearsals exist for `readModelState=loading`, `readModelState=error`, and `readModelState=missing-config`; idle context handling is also browser-checked.
- README.md now documents the local Frontend v2 QA runway for Command Center, the four hash pages, 390px checks, and DEV-only state rehearsals.
- P2.5 RC hardening has browser-clicked the Command Center `黄金链路` entries, verified visible keyboard focus rings, and re-run the five-page RC matrix at 1440px / 1024px / 390px.
- P2.5 boundary-state matrix has rechecked loading, error, missing-config, and missing-id idle states at 1024px and 390px with no console errors or horizontal overflow.
- P2.6 click affordance pass has converted Command Center fake heading actions into real links, confirmed read-model card selection, and clarified disabled read-only action semantics.
- P2.7 command rail hygiene has reduced Command Center rail entries to unique hash scenes and added hash-aware `aria-current` active state.
- P2.8 Risk / Approval scene depth adds read-only detail cards for risk impact, owner, suggested action, approval state, approval impact, and next step; direct `#risk` / `#approvals` hash loads are stabilized with Command Center scene state.
- P2.9 Command Center side-detail helpers now live in the view-model layer, using stable risk IDs plus approval type/state instead of component-local copy guessing.
- P2.11 read-model workspace helpers now live in `readModelViewModels.ts`: asset labels/tone, QC result labels, review item tone, delivery checklist labels, and delivery artifact derivation are no longer component-local.
- P2.12 read-model workspace components now live in `readModelWorkspaces.tsx`, while `ReadModelPages.tsx` owns route params, read-model state, mock-first loading, and page shell only.
- P2.13 read-only route QA is now scripted through `scripts/qa-readonly-routes.ps1`, covering Command Center plus six promoted hash scenes and the four read-model pages at 1440px and 390px.
- P2.14 read-model boundary-state QA is now scripted through `scripts/qa-readonly-boundary-states.ps1`, covering loading, error, missing-config, and missing-id idle states at 1024px and 390px.
- P2.15 local validation orchestration now allows `scripts/validate-local.ps1 -IncludeBrowserQa` to run lint/build, whitespace, changed-file secret scan, route QA, and boundary-state QA from one local entry point.
- P2.16/P2.17 now align the Bash validation helper and add `scripts/qa-readonly-interactions.ps1` for read-model tabs, local selection state, and disabled action posture.
- P2.18 adds a Bash validation runtime preflight so incompatible Bash/WSL Node versions fail early with a clear Vite 7 Node requirement instead of failing deep inside `npm run build`.
- P2.19 adds the same Node runtime preflight to the PowerShell validation helper so both local validation entry points guard Vite 7's Node requirement before npm gates.
- P2.20 adds `scripts/qa-readonly-all.ps1` as a single local browser-QA entry point and makes both validation helpers call it in browser-QA mode.
- P3.1 read-model runtime state surface now exposes visible chips for read source, runtime status, transport posture, and `mock-first / read-only` write boundary across all four read-model pages.
- P3.2 Command Center runtime state surface now exposes the same read source, runtime status, transport posture, and `mock-first / read-only` write boundary chips on the main cockpit, including DEV-only loading/error rehearsals; route QA now asserts the cockpit runtime chip copy across ready/loading/error states.
- `--ps-*` token aliases and text-color compatibility aliases exist in `src/styles/tokens.css`.
- Current long-track focus is post-RC read-only UX tightening, reusable local QA, and optional backend read-model smoke testing only when a local backend base URL is explicitly configured.

## Overall Gaps

| Gap | Impact | Recommended action | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| User-facing copy was mostly English. | Completed for main Command Center and read-model surfaces; continue watching new UI copy. | Keep future visible copy Chinese-first. | P0 done |
| v2 `--ps-*` visual tokens were absent from local token bridge. | Completed as a compatibility bridge; future components should prefer stable token aliases. | Use existing `--ps-*` and `--color-text-*` aliases before adding new token names. | P0 done |
| Command Center needed Chinese alignment. | Completed for shell, gauges, rail, risk, approval, activity, and Agent inspection copy. | Preserve the current composition while adding P1 scene depth. | P0 done |
| Asset Inbox dedicated workspace. | Completed as a read-only scene; continue browser QA when shared rail or read-model styles change. | Preserve the current read-only posture and reuse its selection/preview pattern. | P1 done |
| QC / Retouch dedicated workspace. | Completed as a read-only scene; continue checking failure-detail and disabled action posture. | Preserve the current read-only posture and reuse its queue/detail pattern. | P1 done |
| Review Gallery dedicated workspace. | Completed as a read-only client-review scene. | Preserve the current read-only posture and reuse its grid/selected-detail pattern. | P1B done |
| Delivery Readiness dedicated workspace. | Completed as a read-only delivery outbox scene. | Preserve disabled download/external delivery posture until a separate approved production phase. | P1B done |
| Mock data mirrors the first Golden Product Loop at the read-model level. | Completed for P1 asset/QC/review/delivery fixture counts. | Reuse fixture IDs across Review / Delivery UI, deriving extra frontend context in view models only. | P1 done |
| Cross-page production context and Command Center entry clarity. | Completed with shared read-model context bar plus Command Center `黄金链路` strip. | Keep entry links read-only and verify them when route or fixture IDs change. | P1B done |
| Command Center responsive cockpit polish. | 1280px side rail and 390px topbar status issues were fixed and browser-checked. | Continue checking 1440px / 1024px / 390px after future cockpit layout changes. | P2 done |
| Read-model shared UI duplication. | Disabled action pairs and metric strips are shared components. | Add more shared pieces only when concrete duplication appears; avoid speculative abstractions. | P2 done |
| Read-model boundary-state rehearsal. | DEV-only query states cover loading, error, missing-config, and missing-id idle checks without backend writes. | Keep these states local and read-only; do not use them as production auth/backend behavior. | P2 done |
| Local QA runway. | README documents local routes, 390px checks, and DEV-only boundary rehearsals. | Use the README route list before future P2/P3 visual or read-model changes. | P2 done |
| Keyboard focus visibility. | Command Center links and read-model tabs/cards now expose visible focus rings. | Keep future links/buttons/selectable cards covered by `:focus-visible` styles. | P2.5 done |
| RC browser matrix. | Command Center plus four read-model pages passed 1440px / 1024px / 390px checks; boundary states passed 1024px / 390px checks. | Re-run this matrix after route, layout, or shared style changes. | P2.5 done |
| Click affordance clarity. | Command Center heading actions navigate to target hash scenes; read-model cards select local detail; disabled actions expose read-only disabled posture. | Future visible actions must either navigate, update local read-only UI state, or remain clearly disabled. | P2.6 done |
| Command rail scene hygiene. | The rail now exposes one entry each for #risk, #projects, #approvals, #activity, and #inspections, with one hash-aware active state. | Keep future rail additions unique and browser-check `aria-current` after click. | P2.7 done |
| Risk / Approval scene depth. | #risk and #approvals now expose focused read-only detail lists, and direct hash loads are stable after React render. | Keep details derived from read-model/mock state and avoid introducing approval writes. | P2.8 done |
| Command Center side-detail view model. | Risk detail and approval detail derivation moved out of the component and into `commandCenterViewModel.ts`. | Extend stable mapping in the view-model layer when adding risk IDs or approval types. | P2.9 done |
| Read-model workspace view model cleanup. | Asset label/tone, QC result label/value, review tone, delivery checklist labels, and delivery artifact derivation moved out of `ReadModelPages.tsx`. | Keep page components focused on local selection state and rendering; add future read-model derivation to `readModelViewModels.ts`. | P2.11 done |
| Read-model workspace component split. | Asset Inbox, QC / Retouch, Review Gallery, and Delivery Readiness workspace components moved out of `ReadModelPages.tsx` into `readModelWorkspaces.tsx`. | Keep route/data-state orchestration in `ReadModelPages.tsx`; add future workspace-only UI changes in `readModelWorkspaces.tsx`. | P2.12 done |
| Scripted read-only route QA. | Local QA script checks 10 hash routes across desktop and 390px for Chinese copy, required selectors, rail active state, console errors, and horizontal overflow. | Run `scripts/qa-readonly-routes.ps1` after route, layout, rail, or read-model page changes while the Vite server is running. | P2.13 done |
| Scripted boundary-state QA. | Local QA script checks all four read-model pages across loading, error, missing-config, and missing-id idle states at 1024px and 390px. | Run `scripts/qa-readonly-boundary-states.ps1` after read-model state, shell, notice, or responsive style changes. | P2.14 done |
| Local validation orchestration. | `scripts/validate-local.ps1` now performs changed-file secret scan and can run both browser QA matrices via `-IncludeBrowserQa`. | Use default mode for fast local gates and `-IncludeBrowserQa` before larger read-only UI commits when the dev server is running. | P2.15 done |
| Scripted interaction QA. | Local QA script checks read-model tab switching, local card selection, and disabled read-only actions at desktop and 390px. | Run through `scripts/qa-readonly-interactions.ps1` or the full validation helper after read-model interaction changes. | P2.17 done |
| Bash validation environment guard. | `scripts/validate-local.sh` checks Node.js before npm gates and reports the Vite 7 requirement when Bash/WSL exposes an incompatible runtime. | Use PowerShell validation on this machine unless the Bash/WSL Node runtime is `20.19+` or `22.12+`. | P2.18 done |
| PowerShell validation environment guard. | `scripts/validate-local.ps1` also checks Node.js before npm gates and reports the Vite 7 requirement when the shell runtime is incompatible. | Keep both validation helpers aligned when changing project runtime gates. | P2.19 done |
| Full browser QA aggregation. | `scripts/qa-readonly-all.ps1` runs the route, boundary-state, and interaction matrices in sequence; both validation helpers use it for browser-QA mode. | Run the aggregate script before broad read-only UI handoffs instead of remembering three separate commands. | P2.20 done |
| Read-model runtime state surface. | Context bar now shows read source, runtime status, transport posture, and read-only write boundary across all four read-model scenes. | Keep future runtime states derived in `useBackendReadModel`; do not leak production URLs or secrets into UI. | P3.1 done |
| Command Center runtime state surface. | Main cockpit now shows read source, runtime status, transport posture, and read-only write boundary in ready/loading/error states. | Keep future Command Center runtime posture derived in `useCommandCenterSnapshot`; do not expose backend URLs or secret-bearing config. | P3.2 done |
| Optional backend read-model smoke. | Still intentionally not run in this frontend-only mock-first batch. | Run only with a deliberately configured local `VITE_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL` outside this repo. | P2 blocked |

## Command Center Gap Table

v2 target references: A + C visual anchors, UI/UX principles, information architecture, visual checklist.

| Dimension | Current frontend | v2 target | Gap | Copy alignment | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Left navigation | Rail exposes five unique Chinese hash scenes: `风险雷达`, `项目执行`, `审批队列`, `活动时间线`, and `Agent 巡检`. | Left Chinese navigation should clearly expose production scenes without duplicate active targets. | Done for current Command Center scenes; Asset/QC/Review/Delivery stay in the `黄金链路` strip for this stage. | Keep future rail additions unique and Chinese-first. | P2.7 done |
| Top bar | Compact Chinese studio/date/time status line is visible and 390px browser-checked. | Project switcher / search / risk summary / Agent status can become later operator controls. | Current stage keeps topbar read-only; no search or write-capable controls are implemented. | `布鲁克林影棚 A`, date, time, live dot. | P2 done |
| Visual tone | Premium dark cockpit is already close to approved direction. | Near-black cold blue, cold white text, restrained border, no cyberpunk, no SaaS table feeling. | Keep current direction; migrate new work to v2 token names and avoid extra saturated colors. | No visible copy change. | P0 |

| Approval queue | `审批队列` exists with request IDs, type/state labels, consequence, and read-only next step details. | Approval UI should show risk label, consequence, approval state, request id, activity link for L3/L4 later. | Done for current read-only side rail; no approval writes or payload mutation are implemented. | `审批队列`, `待处理`, `已清除`, `阻塞`, `下一步`. | P2.9 done |
| Activity timeline | Chinese curated activity timeline is visible in the lower execution panel and can be promoted by `#activity`. | Bottom timeline should be visible and curated, not raw logs. | Done for current Alpha. | `活动时间线`, `拍摄完成`, `质检通过`, `精修完成`. | P2.7 done |
| Agent inspection | `Agent 巡检` feed is visible and can be promoted by `#inspections`. | Agent is an inspector, not an unauthorized operator. | Done for read-only Alpha; suggestions remain non-mutating. | `Agent 巡检`, `巡检预警`, `打开质检 / 精修`. | P2.7 done |
